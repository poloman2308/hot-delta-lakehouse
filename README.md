A production-grade Delta Lakehouse pipeline that ingests, transforms, and analyzes IoT sensor logs using Apache Spark, Delta Lake, and Databricks Community Edition.

> Supports both batch and streaming ingestion, layered data architecture (Bronze/Silver/Gold), time travel, Z-Ordering, and external CSV export.

## 📦 Tech Stack

- **Apache Spark (PySpark)** – distributed data processing
- **Delta Lake** – ACID transactions and data versioning
- **Databricks** – notebook orchestration and Delta integration
- **Structured Streaming** – real-time file ingestion
- **Pandas + Flask** *(optional)* – lightweight API server
- **Power BI** *(optional)* – BI/visualization layer

## 🏗️ Layered Architecture

| Layer  | Description                                      |
|--------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Bronze | Raw sensor logs (batch + streaming support)      |
| Silver | Cleaned, deduplicated, schema-validated data     |
| Gold   | Aggregated hourly temperature + humidity metrics |

## ⚙️ How to Use

### ▶️ 1. Run in Databricks

1. Upload all `notebooks/` into your Databricks Workspace.
2. Create `/FileStore/iot_stream` to simulate streaming input.
3. Run the following notebooks in order:
   - `Bronze_Ingest_Batch`
   - `Silver_Transform`
   - `Gold_Aggregate`
   - Or use `Pipeline_Run_All` to execute them sequentially.

---

### ⚡ 2. Simulate Streaming Ingestion

- Drop a new CSV file (e.g., `batch1.csv`) into `/FileStore/iot_stream`
- It will be ingested in real time by `Bronze_Ingest_Stream`
- Rerun Silver and Gold notebooks to propagate results

---

### 📤 3. Export Gold Layer to CSV

Use the `Gold_Export_to_CSV` notebook (or `src/export_gold_csv.py`) to:
- Export the `sensor_hourly_avg` table
- Rename and download via:

👉 [iot_gold_export](https://community.cloud.databricks.com/files/gold_export/iot_gold_export.csv)

## 🧪 Sample Data Format

To test the pipeline locally or in Databricks, create a file named:

```text
data/sample_sensor_data.csv
```
With the following content:
```csv
sensor_id,timestamp,temperature,humidity,location
1001,2025-05-01 00:00:00,72.4,41.2,Room_A
1002,2025-05-01 00:00:05,75.1,45.9,Room_B
```
You can manually drop this into /FileStore/iot_stream to simulate a stream event.
